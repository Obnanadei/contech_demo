[@sunnydeveloper](https://twitter.com/sunnydeveloper)

"During a successful career as a software developer, Emma discovered open source and was inspired by the potential of developing software collaboratively - especially the opportunity to connect with others around shared purpose. This led to contribution and participation in many projects over the years including Drupal, MySQL and Mozilla - she even maintained a few of her own small projects.

Emma brought her passion for technology and people into her role as an open source strategist at Mozilla where she spent seven years focused on empowering product teams, and their contributors. She's most proud of her of her work developing the first-ever diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy for open source communities, and contributing this work to the CHAOSS D\&I working group. Emma now brings that same passion for people and open source to her role as a PM Microsoft's Open Source Programs Office (OSPO). She can't believe her good fortune to be working with Stormy Peters and the rest of the talented OSPO team and hopes this isn't just a dream!"

<summary>Keynote: All of the People, All of the Time: A holistic approach to building empowered open source culture in your organization</summary>

As an ecosystem, open source has been making vast improvements in how we think about and design for community and contributor success. What's lacking is an investment, and common language needed to build healthy open source culture inside organizations; the success of which can have direct and lasting impact in communities, and the products we're working on together.

In this talk, Emma will share how she evaluates and designs for a healthy, and inclusive open source culture within Microsoft using building blocks of empowerment, purpose, trust and belonging.

[@isaferreira\_57](https://twitter.com/isaferreira\_57)

Isabella Ferreira is currently a PhD candidate at Polytechnique Montréal working under the direction of Dr. Jinghui Cheng and Dr. Bram Adams. Her research focuses on investigating (in)civility in Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) communities. Her main research interests are mining software repositories, affective computing, and software maintenance and evolution.

<details>

<summary>Session: Characterizing and Detecting Incivility in Open Source Code Review Discussions</summary>

Code review is an important quality assurance activity for open source software development. Yet, code review discussions among developers and maintainers can be heated and sometimes involve personal attacks and unnecessary disrespectful comments, demonstrating, therefore, incivility. Although incivility in public discussions has received increasing attention from researchers in different domains, the understanding of this phenomenon is still very limited in the context of software development and, more specifically, code review. To address this gap, this proposed talk will present the results of a qualitative analysis conducted on 1,545 emails from the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) that were associated with rejected changes. From this analysis, we identified the features of discussion of civil and uncivil communication as well as the causes and consequences of uncivil communication. Based on our results and with the goal to create healthier and more attractive open source communities, we will also discuss in this talk (i) approaches that could be used to address incivility before and after it happens, (ii) pitfalls to avoid when trying to automatically detect incivility, and (iii) heuristics for detecting incivility in code review discussions.

<summary>Session: Mystic - An initial effort in academic metrics, impact and community</summary>

The last few years have seen a significant uptick in interest in the concept of Open Source Program Offices in academic and governmental entities. Last year the EU adopted an Open Source Strategy for 2020-2023. This year, the United States, The National Academies for Science, Engineering and Mathematics, has called for presidents and provosts of colleges and universities to significantly increase support for Open Work across all colleges and universities in the US. This panel will start with members of the OSPO++ working group (that meets regularly to encourage the creation of municipal and academic OSPOs) will briefly introduce attendees to the needs of these developer and user communities. It will then move to a demo of Mystic, and Open@RIT effort to use GrimoireLab to collect data and display data on faculty Open Work contributions. Questions for all panelists will be encouraged in the last ten minutes.

## Sean Goggins

![Sean Goggins](https://chaoss.github.io/website/CHAOSScon/2020EU/images/sean-goggins.png)_Associate Professor - University of Missouri_\
[@sociallycompute](https://twitter.com/sociallycompute)

Sean is an open source software researcher and a founding member of the Linux Foundation’s working group on community health analytics for open source software CHAOSS, co-lead of the CHAOSS metrics software working group and leader of the open source metrics tool AUGUR which can be forked and cloned and experimented wtih on GitHub. After a decade as a software engineer, Sean decided his calling was in research. His open source research is framed around a broader agenda of social computing research, which he pursues as an associate professor of computer science at the University of Missouri.

Sean is also the founder of the Data Science and Analytics Masters program at Missouri, which he’s now passed on to people who want administrative empire. Sean’s publications focus on understanding how social technologies influence organizational, small group and community dynamics, typically including analysis of electronic trace data from systems combined with the perspectives of people whose behavior is traced. Group Informatics is a methodology and ontology Sean has articulated with the aim of helping build consensus among researchers and developers for how to ethically and systematically make sense of electronic trace data. Structural fluidity, a construct Sean developed with his collaborators Peppo Valetto and Kelly Blincoe, aims to make sense of structural dynamics in virtual software organizations, and how those dynamics affect performance. Working with Josh Introne, Bryan Semaan and Ingrid Erickson, Sean is elaborating on mechanisms for identifying structural fluidity and organizational dynamics in electronic trace data using the lens of complex systems theory. The Authors won ""Best Paper of 2020"" in the Journal for the Association of Information Systems and Technology (JASIS\&T) for their work. Sean's other work includes collaborations with Matt Germonprez on the Open Collaboration Data Exchange and Open Source Health metrics projects. He lives in Columbia, MO with his wife Kate, two step daughters and a dog named Huckleberry.

<summary>Session: A complex web of open source software dependencies risk</summary>

Today, software project development is nearly impossible without the use of interdependent components. These interdependencies have such a strong impact that software projects often fail if an open-source project library malfunctions. This was observed in the NPM project, when an open-source project contributor deleted 11 lines of code that he had contributed to an open-source library causing many other projects dependent on this library to fail. This presentation will present a synthesis of the complexity of managing dependencies, and the relationship between open source software dependency metrics, quality assurance, and security. Members of the CHAOSS Risk working group will answer a simple yet a complex question: what are the categories of open source software dependencies, and what metrics can make these risks visible. Participants will gain insights into: 1. What to measure? And 2. How to measure dependency risks?

To answer these questions we worked across Linux Foundation projects to identify various dependency issues, and develop a set of metrics based on:

1. Goal
2. Question
3. Metric

Approach. The metrics we then implemented using the CHAOSS Project’s Augur software will demonstrate one approach for visualizing and assessing dependency risk across large project portfolios. The key takeaway is it is work measuring the riskiness of a piece of software you're using or dependent on.

<summary>Session: CHAOSS DEI Badging - From There to Here</summary>

The CHAOSS project would like to share our experience developing, and implementing a peer reviewed event badging program.

The value of appreciating and acknowledging diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in open source communities is underestimated. It is critical to bring together people with different backgrounds, mindsets, ideas and experiences to work for a common cause. The CHAOSS Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Badging Initiative awards badges to events based on their adherence to and prioritization of DEI best practices. The initiative aims to increase understanding of project and event practices that encourage greater diversity and wider inclusion of people from different backgrounds.

This presentation will provide a holistic view of:

* The CHAOSS DEI Badging Initiative
* Examples of badged events and lessons learned from the process
* Ideas on how the badging process may be improved

In particular, we will highlight the people, technologies, and processes that have made the CHAOSS DEI Badging Initiative a success to date.
